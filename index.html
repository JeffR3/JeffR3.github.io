  <h2>Personal Values</h2>
  <p>Every person has different skills. Even if the multiple people have the same skill, they might have different priorities. Not to mention that they might have gaps in their knowledge. There are many permutations for the solution that the business needs. (This is not even including if this is the correct solution)</p>
  <p>Most of my decision making is based on my core values:</p>
  <ul><li>Efficiency on <em>effectiveness</em> </li>
    <li>Communication on <em>trust</em> </li>
    <li><em>Curiosity</em> for collaboration </li>
    <li>Data to doubt</li>
    </ul>
  <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>
  <h2>Let it breathe</h2>
  <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p>
    <p>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>
    <h2>A little less contrast</h2>
    <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>
    <h2>Size Matters</h2>
    <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>
    <h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
    <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
    <h3>Yes, this is <em>also</em> fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
    <p>I love what the creator of <a
href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
