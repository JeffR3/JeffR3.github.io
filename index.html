  <h2>Personal Values</h2>
  <p>Every person has different skills. Even if the multiple people have the same skill, they might have different priorities. Not to mention that they might have gaps in their knowledge. There are many permutations for the solution that the business needs. (This is not even including if this is the correct solution)</p>
  <p>Most of my decision making is based on my core values:</p>
  <ul><li>Efficiency on <em>effectiveness</em> </li>
    <li>Communication on <em>trust</em> </li>
    <li><em>Curiosity</em> for collaboration </li>
    <li>Data to doubt</li>
    </ul>
